    <h1>Help</h1>
    <p class="welcome">
      Welcome to the help page for <strong>Join</strong>, your guide to using our kanban project management tool.
      Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Join?</h2>
     <p><strong>Join</strong> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p> 
 
      <p>  Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).<strong>Join </strong>leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>

       <p> It is important to note that <strong>Join</strong> is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <strong>Join.</strong></p>

    <h2>How to use it</h2>
    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>

    <ol class="steps">
      <li>
        <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
        <p>
          When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
          and contains four default lists: “To Do”, “In Progress”, “Await feedback” and “Done”.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
        <p>
          In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the “Contacts” section,
          click on “New contact”, and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be
          assigned tasks and interact with the tasks on the board.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
        <p>
          After adding your contacts, start adding cards (individual tasks). Click the “+” button
          under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in details like task name, description,
          due date, assignees, etc.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
        <p>
          As a task moves from one stage to another, reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping
          the card from one list to another.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
        <p>
          Once a task is completed, you can move it to the “Done” list or delete it. Deleting a card
          permanently removes it from the board. Please use caution — this action is irreversible.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="Remember">
      Remember that using <strong>Join</strong> effectively requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure
      the board reflects the current state of your project.
